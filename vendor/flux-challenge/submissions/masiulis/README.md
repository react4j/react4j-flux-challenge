## React with no FLUX

This is an experiment that shows how leaving everything inside the component tree would look like.

Don't recommend doing this at home, it is probably much easier to use Reflux.

It is a rough draft and could look much better with some Rx and immutable.js. But the idea is here.

One thing that I liked is how one-way data flow gives fully encapsulated logic. It's super easy to find where the logic is.
Does not make it easier to understand it because of how little separation of concerns there is.
