# React4j Flux Challenge implementation

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-flux-challenge.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/react4j/react4j-flux-challenge)

An solution for the problem presented in the [flux challenge](https://github.com/staltz/flux-challenge). The
implementation uses Arez and React4j. The source code has been vendored into this repository and the original
challenge can be read at [vendor/flux-challenge/README.md](vendor/flux-challenge/README.md).

The project must run against the server supplied by the flux-challenge. To set it up run the following commands:

    $  cd vendor/flux-challenge/server
    $  npm install
    $  npm start

This will start the server and the original submission at at [http://localhost:3000/s/](http://localhost:3000/s/).

The solution can be run through the GWT DevServer and is available at
[http://127.0.0.1:8888/sithtracker_dev/](http://127.0.0.1:8888/sithtracker_dev/) but it is assumed that you know
enough about Buildr/GWT/etc to get yourself to a running DevServer.
